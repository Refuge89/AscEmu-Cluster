# IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING LICENSING

Written 2015-10-25 by Evairfairy (https://github.com/Evairfairy) on behalf of AscEmu Team <http://ascemu.org>.

New files contributed to AscEmu are released under the MIT license (which can be found below). Code released under this license can be used in conjunction with the existing AGPL (GNU Affero General Public License) licensed code base, however doing so will apply the restrictions imposed by the AGPL on the MIT licensed code.

**Unless explicitly stated at the top of the file, code in this project is considered to be placed under the AGPL**. This does not apply to SQL files, which are generated automatically and assumed to be released under MIT.

The goal moving forward is to replace the existing AGPL licensed code with our own MIT licensed code - this means **we cannot copy code from existing files into new MIT licensed files unless the code was written by us (i.e. after the fork from ArcEmu)**.

Additionally, all future code contributed to the project is considered to be under MIT license. If you have previously contributed code to AscEmu and do not wish for us to use your code anymore, please notify us and we will remove it or move it to an AGPL licensed file.
